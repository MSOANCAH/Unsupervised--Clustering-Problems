Steps :

1.Design the model for events(contains events keywords)

2.Search Twitter data, get tweets related to the events

3.Store the data and fetch only tweets(text) from json file

4.Feature extracting and clustering ( tweets )

5. Stemming new data from tweeter and predicting the cluster for every tweet
like tweet1 -->cluster 1
tweet2-->cluster 3 and so on...


Things I missed

unfortunately I can not spend much time at this moment on this problem

so there are few things i did not do it (as they take much time for me to do it)

1.Cluster time series
2.MongoDB storage
