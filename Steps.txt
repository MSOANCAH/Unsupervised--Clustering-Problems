Steps :

1.Design the model for events(contains events keywords)

2.Search Twitter data, get tweets related to the events

3.Store the data and fetch only tweets(text) from json file

4.Feature extracting and clustering ( tweets )

5. Stemming new data from tweeter and predicting the cluster for every tweet
like tweet1 -->cluster 1
tweet2-->cluster 3 and so on...

How to run

1. Add Tweeter config data (key and secret)

2. Run MongoDB instance (if you want to store the data)

3. Edit the json file locations path in the code

4. Open terminal run the code (giving the two json files path as arguments)

Things I missed

unfortunately I can not spend much time at this moment on this problem

so there are few things i did not do it (as they take much time for me to do it)

1.Cluster time series
2.MongoDB storage
